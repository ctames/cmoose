Things to accomplish for Architecture project:

1. Be able to handle a queue (file) of binary instructions
2. In executing these instructions, emulate the 5 stage MIPS pipeline
3. implement very basic "main memory" so that store/load and instructions can be done

Design:

1. while loop, with each iteration representing a cycle
	- be able to "step" and "run"
	- display information about state of registers, functional units, pipeline stages
2. need to able to handle dependencies
	- forwarding?
	- inserting stalls
